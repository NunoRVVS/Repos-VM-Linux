    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Katsu curry is just a variation of Japanese curry with a chicken cutlet on top. 
        I used a store-bought block of Japanese curry roux which is commonly used in Japanese households. 
        Chicken Cutlet (Japanese version of chicken schnitzel) brings the Japanese curry up to the next level. It’s so delicious and filling.
        It is not an exaggeration to say that Japanese curry rice <strong>(カレーライス, pronounce it as ‘karē raisu’)</strong> is the national home cooking dish. 
        When Japanese people say ‘having a curry tonight’, it is the Japanese curry that is made from the store-bought block of curry roux.

            <li>large carrot, chopped</li> 
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>4 garlic cloves, chopped</li>
            <li>large piece of ginger, chopped</li>
            <li>2 tbsp mild curry powder</li>
            <li>1 tbsp honey</li>
            <li>1 tbsp ketchup</li>
            <li>1 tbsp red or brown miso paste</li>
            <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
            <li>1 chicken stock cube</li>
            <li>white cabbage, shredded nori, sesame seeds and cooked rice, to serve</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps to do it</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 200° C</li>
            <li>Add the chopped carrot and onion to a deep non-stick frying pan along with 
                the coconut oil and gently fry on a medium/ low heat. Season with salt.</li>
            <li>After 5 minutes:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>add the minced garlic</li>
                    <li>curry powder</li>
                    <li>ginger</li>
                    <li>turmeric</li>
                    <li>honey</li>
                    <li>soy sauce and flour with a splash of the chicken stock</li>
                    <li>ginger</li>
                    <li>Gently fry for another minute before slowly adding all of the chicken stock, then reduce to a simmer and set the timer for 20 minutes.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Now start to prepare the chicken by slicing the 3 breasts along the width to create 6 thin chicken pieces. You can start the crispy chicken conveyor 
                belt by rolling it in flour, then the beaten egg and finally in the breadcrumbs. If you want the crispiest chicken, you can double dip into the egg 
                and breadcrumbs although you may require more breadcrumbs.
            </li>
            <li>
                Drizzle half of the rapeseed oil onto a baking tray and then add the battered chicken and then drizzle the remaining rapeseed oil over the top to coat. 
                Pop in the oven, timer set to 12 minutes to rotate and cook for a further 12 minutes on the other side. While the chicken is baking in the oven, boil a 
                kettle and cook the rice according to packet instructions.
            </li>
            <li>
                The katsu sauce should have thickened slightly after around 20 minutes, so it’s ready to blend.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, slice the chicken diagonally for that Wagamama look and serve up with a portion of 
                rice, a ladle of the sauce and the optional sliced spring onion & chilli flakes.
            </li>
        </ol>
